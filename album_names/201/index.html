<p>It is one of the classic albums that symbolizes Korea's second-generation indie scene,
    and is still considered Black Skirts' best work, even though Black Skirts has
    released five full-length albums. Overall, it is based on the rough punk rock of the
    British and American camps, and is an album that shows exotic yet sophisticated musicality
    by mixing the melodic guitar pop of the Strokes or Suede with the soft modern rock
    sensibility of the Korean indie scene. With this album, Black Skirt was nominated in
    five categories at the 2010 Korean Music Awards, winning the Best Modern Rock Album
    award.

    You can't listen to it on music sites, but it's because he left Ruby Salon,
     which was his agency at the time. So, you can listen to the 201 Special Edition,
      in which 201 is remastered + bonus tracks are added. The widely known album art
      is also 201 Special Edition.
    
    Because of the swear words in Tangled, the 201 album was rated 19 gold.
    When Hyang Music ONLY was sold, it was not a 19+ album. It appears that the 19+ label
    was probably attached during the official distribution process.
    
    The album name refers to the area code of New Jersey, where Jo Hyu-il lived.</p>
