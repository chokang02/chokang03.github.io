    <h3><a href="../thirsty_copy/index.html" class="href" id="number">THIRSTY</a></h3>
    <p>Thirsty is the fourth studio album by South Korean indie rock artist The Black Skirts.
        The album was released on 12 February 2019. The album won the best modern rock album at the
        2020 Korean Music Awards.</p>
        <p>Thirsty is the second album in the "love trilogy" of The Black Skirts.
            He expressed that the album contains the most "The Black Skirts-like music" about
            what people go through and what they can do, and he released Queen of Diamonds (ì„¬)
             as a teaser before the album's release. Some sexual flagrant lyrics in
              some tracks on the album caused controversy.</p>
              <p>Kim Doheon of IZM reviewed "Having reassured everyone with sweet words, he now brings
                 out his hungry desire, saying, "A black heart just comes out of my mouth."
                 Thirsty is a devastated love, a lively grotesque tragedy."
                  Jeonjainhyeong of Music Y described the album as "Just as Joker is more
                   attractive than Batman and Darth Vader is more attractive than Anakin,
                    the scenery shown by Thirsty is a rare sight in Korean music.
                     This is where The Black Skirts talked about the brazen grotesque, and why he
                      does not sink and continues to exert influence in the contemporary music world."</p>
