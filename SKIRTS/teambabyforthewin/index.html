    <h3><a href="../team_baby_copy/index.html" class="href" id="number">TEAM BABY</a></h3>
    <p>Team Baby is the third studio album by South Korean rock musician The Black Skirts.
        The album was released on 30 May 2017. The album was nominated for album of the
        year at the 2018 Korean Music Awards.</p>
        <p>n 2016, The Black Skirts signed with label HIGHGRND, where Tablo is the owner.
            The album cover is a wedding photo of his parents, and The Black Skirts described
            the album as "going to be a very mature album."</p>
              <p>Park Sangjoon of Music Y said "It's hard to pick only the best one song in
                Team Baby. As such, all songs are beautiful and boast excellent
                completeness." Kang Minjeong of IZM reviewed "Despite filling most songs
                with the theme of common love, the reason why they are not burdened or bitten
                is because of their unique dry texture."</p>
